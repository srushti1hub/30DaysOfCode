First we need to extract the number from the user.
In the loops first we need to extract the individual numbers from right to left and change their positions which means in a 3 digit number the number in oneâ€™s place will go to hundreds place. We have to update the number number as number/10 and give a condition that loop termites when number/10 = 0.We will extract a single number by doing, rem= number%10 and before loop starts we initialize and rev = 0 and we will now reverse the number in the loop by updating rev as
rev= rev * 10 + rem. And finally after number=0 we will print the value of rev.
We will now a detailed structure by taking example and let the number to be reversed is 123. 

Loop 1:
We have initialized rev=0 rem=number%10=123%10=3 rev=0*10+3=3
number = 123/10=12

Loop 2 :
Now rev will be 3
rem=12%10=2 rev=3*10+2=32 number=12/10=1 

Loop 3:
Now rev is 32 rem=1%10=1 rev=32*10+1=321 number= 1/10=0
So our reversed number is 321.
